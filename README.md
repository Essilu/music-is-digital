# Music is digital

> Python Project L1 Semester 1 (2020-2021) at EFREI Paris
> By Ulysse  and Elliot 

## Usage

Once you have this folder on you computer, you can run the following command in a command-prompt, to install the needed dependencies:
```
$ pip install turtle numpy simpleaudio prettytable
```

Then you can run the program with:
```
$ python3 ./src/main.py
```
Make sure to run it with python 3. We were using python 3.8.5 during development.
